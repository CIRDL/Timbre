# Timbre

A decentralized music platform built on top of **Audius**, offering a unique fan-investment model and micropayments for artists.

## Overview

Timbre integrates the power of blockchain and music streaming to create a decentralized platform where artists can directly connect with fans, monetize their music, and raise capital through fan investments. Built on the **Audius API**, Timbre leverages **micropayments** as the primary revenue stream for artists while offering an option for fans to invest in artist shares.

## Features

- **Micropayments**: Artists earn **AUDIO tokens** based on streaming performance, allowing fans to support artists directly through decentralized payments.
- **Fan Investment**: Artists have the option to **go public**, enabling fans to invest in a share of their future earnings. This share is capped at a percentage of their total revenue to ensure the artist retains most of their income.
- **Revenue Aggregation**: Future development will integrate **ticket sales** and **merchandise payments** through the platform, using AUDIO tokens, to further monetize the artist-fan relationship.
- **Artist Market Cap**: A dynamic artist market cap will be calculated based on the total value of fan investments, with a potential for share expansion as an artist's popularity grows.

## System Architecture

Timbre consists of the following components:

- **Audius Integration**: Using the **Audius API** to handle decentralized music streaming and micropayments in AUDIO tokens.
- **Smart Contracts**: Implementing smart contracts for:

  - Tracking fan investments and managing artist revenue shares.
  - Enforcing revenue distribution rules (e.g., capping the percentage distributed to investors).
  - Managing tokenized artist shares, potentially expanding as artist popularity increases.

- **Revenue Engine**: All streams, ticket sales, and merchandise payments are aggregated on-chain. A percentage of the revenue is distributed to fans based on their investment.

## Future Ideas

- **Index Funds for Artists**: Create artist index funds grouped by genre, growth potential, etc.
- **VC-like Investments**: Introduce a venture-capital-style system for discovering and investing in emerging artists.
- **Derivatives Market**: Build a derivatives market allowing fans and investors to trade futures on stream or revenue performance.

## Development Roadmap

- **MVP**:
  - Implement basic **micropayment integration** using the Audius API.
  - Build the **fan investment model** with capped returns to investors.
  - Smart contract deployment for investment tracking and revenue distribution.
- **Phase 2**:

  - Integrate **ticket payments** and **merchandise sales** as part of the artist revenue pool.
  - Introduce dynamic **market cap calculations** for artists, linked to fan investments.

- **Phase 3**:
  - Explore **prediction markets** and expand on data analytics for artists.
  - Experiment with fan-driven **artist index funds** and VC-like models.
